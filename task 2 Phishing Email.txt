Subject: ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required: Unusual Sign-in Activity Detected
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook 16.0


Step 4: Check Links and Attachments

Attachment: Activity_Report.html 
( .html file could contain fake login page )

 Step 5: Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
 
 Urgency:	‚Äú48 hours or account restricted‚Äù
 
 
 Step 6: Mismatched URLs
 
 rnicrosoft.com instead of microsoft.com
 
  Step 7: Look for Spelling or Grammar Mistakes
  
  "If this was not you..."	‚ùå Grammar	Correct grammar is: "If this were not you..." 
  
  Spelling: No spelling mistakes found.
  Grammar: One subtle grammar error ("was" vs. "were") that‚Äôs common in phishing emails.
Style: Lacks the professional tone Microsoft typically uses; signature format is inconsistent.

 Step 8: Write Your Analysis Summary (for Report)
